# AVL_BST-Splay_BST
Implementation of an AVL (Adelson-Velskii and Landis) or Height binary tree done in C++ as well as an implementation of a Splay tree in C++. The performance of these data structures has also been analyzed and the results are included in the repository

To run the code, you can go the Analysis folder which contains the Makefile and run analysis.cpp

(The original repository on which I worked was in my courses' github organization and it was private, so I have uploaded the code over here for public viewing)
